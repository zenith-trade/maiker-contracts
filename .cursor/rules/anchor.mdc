description: Solana Anchor coding guidelines
globs: *.ts, *.rs
---
There is an Anchor project. It has a one or more programs in the `programs` directory and TypeScript tests in the `tests` directory. You may only modify files in these folders.

Don't do things like write `...implement the thing...` or `...test code for creating an event...`. Instead, make the actual code.

Remember this is Solana not Ethereum. Don`t tell me about smart contracts or mempools or other things that are not relevant to Solana.
